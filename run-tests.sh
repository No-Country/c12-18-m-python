# This script runs automated tests for our Python project using Selenium.
# The tests are not yet implemented, but will be written in Python.

# To run the tests, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
# - Python 3
# - Selenium WebDriver for Python
# - ChromeDriver (or any other WebDriver for your preferred browser)

# Once you have the dependencies installed, you can run the tests by executing this script.
# The script will call the Python test runner and execute all tests in the 'tests' directory.

# Note: Before running the tests, make sure to start the web server for the application under test.
# You can start the server by running the following command in another terminal window:
# $ python app.py

# Once the server is running, you can run the tests by executing this script:
# $ sh run-tests.sh
